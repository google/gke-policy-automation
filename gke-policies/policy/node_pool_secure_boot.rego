# title: Secure boot on the nodes
# description: Secure Boot helps ensure that the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature verification fails
# custom:
#   group: Security
#   severity: Medium
#   recommendation: >
#     Once the node pool is provisioned, it cannot be updated to enable Secure Boot.
#     It is required to create new node pool in the cluster with Secure Boot feature
#     enabled.

# title: Control Plane endpoint visibility
# description: Control Plane endpoint should be locked from external access
# custom:
#   group: Security
#   severity: High
#   recommendation: >
#     Once the cluster is created without enabling private control plane address only, this cannon be changed.
#     The cluster must be recreated, ensuring that Private cluster mode is enabled and
#     Public endpoint access is disabled.

# title: Number of services in a cluster
# description: The total number of services running in a cluster
# custom:
#   group: Scalability
#   severity: Medium
#   recommendation: >
#     The performance of iptables used by kube-proxy degrades if there are too many services or
#     the number of backends behind a Service is high. We recommend keeping the number of services in the cluster
#     below the limit.

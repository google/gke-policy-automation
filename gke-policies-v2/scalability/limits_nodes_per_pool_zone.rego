#   severity: Low
#   recommendation: >
#     The limit applies when container-native load balancing with NEGs is not used with GKE Ingress controller.
#     We recommend using container-native load balancing with NEGs (Network Endpoint Groups) to improve the
#     load balancing performance and avoid this limit.

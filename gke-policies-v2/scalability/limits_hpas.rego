# title: Number of HPAs in a cluster
# description: The optimal number of Horizontal Pod Autoscalers in a cluster
# custom:
#   group: Scalability
#   severity: Medium
#   recommendation: >
#     Horizontal Pod Autoscaler doesn't have a hard limit on the supported number of HPA objects.
#     However, above a certain number of HPA objects, the period between HPA recalculations may become longer than the standard 15 seconds.

# title: Control Plane redundancy
# description: GKE cluster should be regional for maximum availability of control plane during upgrades and zonal outages
# custom:
#   group: Availability
#   severity: High
#   recommendation: >
#     Once the cluster is created as a zonal cluster, it is not possible to change it's type to regional.
#     The cluster must be recreated, ensuring that regional location type is choosen.

# title: Ensure that nodes in Node Auto-Provisioning node pools will use Container-Optimized OS
# description: Nodes in Node Auto-Provisioning should use Container-Optimized OS
# custom:
#   group: Security
#   severity: High
#   recommendation: >
#     The node image type for node created by Node Autoprovisioning can be changed from the command
#     line only. To change it to the recommended COS with containerid, run the following command:
#     gcloud container clusters update CLUSTER_NAME --enable-autoprovisioning --autoprovisioning-image-type cos_containerd
#   externalURI: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/node-auto-provisioning#default-image-type
